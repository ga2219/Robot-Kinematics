# Robot-Kinematics
This work involves the design of a software to simulate the motion of a multi-degree of freedom kinematic chains that form the structure of a robotic system. The emphasis on geometry means that the links of the robot are modeled as rigid bodies and its joints are assumed to provide pure rotation or translation.
